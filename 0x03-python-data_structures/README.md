# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
3. The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
4. Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)

### C
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
3. Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
4. Use main.c files to test files
5. The prototypes of all functions are included in a file called lists./h

## Files
| File Name | Description |
| ----------| ------------|
| 0-print_list_integer.py | Write a function that prints all integers of a list. |
| 1-element_at.py | Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. |
| 2-replace_in_list.py | Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). |
| 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py | Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. |
| 4-new_in_list.py | Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). |
